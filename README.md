# Stats-3860
**Course Name:** STATS3860--Generalized Linear Model/Statistical Model 2

_These files are for my SS3860 final project which I took in 2022 winter term._

In this project, my teammate and I investigated and analyzed a variety of variables to find how they influence the state of loans of small businesses during the Pre-Financial Crisis Period. We aim to determine what small businesses should be granted loans in California at the beginning of the financial crisis. The decision making of whether to grant loans leads to a binary classification problem. Back to the present, human beings experience a global economic stagnation due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this environment, we could use the model we create in our paper to solve the same question in the future.

The research paper and coding file are provided in this repository.
